# Leap-Motion-Experiments
Early attempts at a primative virtual keyboard.
You can run the keyboard if you have a Leap Motion device. Attach it and run keyboardv3.py. This will allow you to start typing. To start typing, tap one of your fingers in a sharp downward motion. This will allow you to type into the prompt.
